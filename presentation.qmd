## Aim of the Thesis

-   To propose, and pilot, a practical tool for people that wish to take control of the carbon footprint of their diet
-   To do so in a way that is respectful of the user's autonomy
-   While honestly considering realistic limitations of technology adoption

## Motivation

-   Part of the Behaviour Informatics Studentship (not Digital Civics)
-   Interest in behaviour science
-   Affinity with environmental sustainability
-   Interest in technology and applied science

## Outcomes include

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Four studies that culminate in the development and field evaluation of the MyFootpint app to benefit foodprint literacy (Ch.2-5)
-   A critical reflection on autonomy in persuasive design (Ch.6)

# Overview of Chapters

## Ch.2: Scoping Review (ScSLR)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Scope: Apps to support grocery purchases choices.
-   Outcome: opportunities and challenges with design choices.
-   Key insights:
-   In-store assistants rely on on consistent use and long term adoption, yet do not encourage it.
-   Apps that encourage learning through reflection are more promising.

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Workshops with a card sorting activity
-   Outcome: Attitudes to design features.
-   Key insights:
-   Beyond recommendation, an interest for learning.
-   Mixed opinions about motivational features (mostly critical).

# Limitations

## Limitations include

-   Potential direct impact on environment is limited
-   The application is not a final prototype and leaves ample room for further development (eg, automating data processing, additional options to explore data in the app)
-   Carbon footprint is only part of the picture of environmental sustainability
